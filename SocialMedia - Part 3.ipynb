Details can be found at the  [spaCy web site](https://spaCy.io/), and in this [tutorial](https://nicschrading.com/project/Intro-to-NLP-with-spaCy/). spaCy is built on a neural network model based on recent developments in NLP researzch.

    "Natural Language Processing involves a series of operations on an input text, each building off of the previous step to add additional insight and undertanding.  Thus, many NLP packages run as pipeline processors providing modular components at each stage of the process. Separating key steps into discrete packages provides needed modularity, as developers can modify and customize individual components as needed. spaCy, like other NLP tools including [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk/) and [cTAKES](https://ctaes.apache.org)  operate on such a model. Although the specific components of each pipeline vary from system to system (and from tasks to task, the key tasks are rougly similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Tokenizing*: splitting the text into words, punctuation, and other markers.\n",
    "2. *Part of speech tagging*: Classifying terms as nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, ec.\n",
    "3. *Dependency Parsing* or *Chunking*: Defining relationships between tokens (subject and object of sentence) and grouping into noun and veb phrases.\n",
    "4. *Named Entity Recognition*: Mapping words or phrases to standard vocabularies or other common, known values. This step is often key for linking free text to accepted terms for diseases, symptoms, and/or anatomic locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps might be accomplished through rules, machine learning models, or some combination of approaches. After these initial steps are complete, results might be used to identify relationships between items in the text, build classifiers, or otherwise conduct further analysis. We'll get into these topics later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [spaCy documentation](https://spaCy.io/usage/spaCy-101) and [cTAKES default pipeline description](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CTAKES/Default+Clinical+Pipeline) provide two examples of how these components might be arranged in practice.  For more information on NLP theory and methods, see [Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), perhaps the leading NLP textbook.\n",

Examiine enough tweets to feel confident in your criteria.\n",
